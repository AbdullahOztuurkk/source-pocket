## React Native CLI vs Expo
First of all guys if you want learn and use react native we have two options for developing apps
[Comparing  CLI and Expo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHlAM4ICi1s)

### React Native CLI 
Classic and tiring way to using react native with emulators 
in my opinion you should use ClÄ± if your system resources are enough
* you should setup android studio,java,emulators... etc
* sometimes occur errors during development(I dont know how often that's happening because I am using expo but other says that)
* app sizes are small(when converting apk,ipa)

### Expo
[Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) is a helper for using your phones as an emulator over the wi-fi via [expo go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) app
* easy to create new apps(I mean create new projects and start working is easy but during the development when you want to add some packages for react-native it's cant working some times)
* but huge app size(when you converted only blank project the app size will be about 50mb)
* build to apk take a long time because queue(a blank project is converted at least half an hour it can depends on to your pc power)
